# AD8210-current-limiting-sensor-using-Arduino
This current protection device has a current setting that is used to determine the upper limit of the current that can flow to the load, the current sensor will read the output current from the power supply and compare it with the current setting on the comparator in the microcontroller. The microcontroller will then display the current and setting current on the display, turn off / turn on the indicator and open / close the switch. The load will receive the supply that has been passed through the switch.

This mini project was carried out during an internship by Yusuf, Aufa & Ibnu
